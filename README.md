# Serious-Game
I contributed to some scripts in a serious game using Unity.

During an internship, I worked on a project that aimed to enhance the experience of playing and learning. I contributed to the game's interface and more in the backend, specifically in scripting. I share with you some of the scripts in this repository.

The whole Projet : [GLUPS-123 Repository](https://github.com/FSTT-LIST/GLUPS-123/tree/master)

## PrizeSceneController
I wrote code to handle the puzzles (prizes), shuffle it when a goal is not reached, and clearly display it when the goal is achieved. The objective is to win all the pieces of the puzzle.

## StatsController
I wrote code to generate a CSV file that contains a trace of the player with specific data. This data can be used later to determine which type of learning is efficient (FRS, FIS, VRS, VIS).

## ResolutionSetter
A script to set the custom resolution based on the screen of each computer.

## Last
I have written a lot more code, but I want to share these three scripts. You can check out the game on Play Store: [GLUPS-123](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.glups.m123&hl=en).
